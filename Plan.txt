log5(x)+1 is CR scaling for party size (round down)
Level to CR (x/4 when LV 1or2, x-2 otherwise)

Overall CR for encounter = if LV <= 2
                              CR = (log3(size)+1) * LV/4
                              +/- 0.25
                           else
                              CR = (log3(size)+1) * (LV-2)
